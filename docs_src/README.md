# Tony's software development cookbook

---

##Context

Without a doubt software development requires the usage of a large amount of knowledge about:
- various programming languages (java, kotlin, js, golang...)
- project management/dependencies tools such as maven, npm, gradle, pip
- CI/CD tools (Jenkins, Travis)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE), i.e. IntelliJ Idea, Visual Studio Code
- DevOps (Ansible, Vagrant, VMs, linux)
- Security (password vault, certificates)
- Software quality
    - test libraries (junit, testng, spock)
    - code quality and code conventions (Findbugs, Jacoco, PMD, SonarQube...)
- and a LOT LOT more

##Intention

This book is gonna be fill in with a series of recipes I'm coming across down the software development road.
I hope will be of help for other engineers as they are for me.
