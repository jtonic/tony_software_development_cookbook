## Description
Without a doubt software development requires the usage of a large amount of knowledge about:
- various programming languages, say java, kotlin, js, golang, etc
- project management/dependencies tools, such as maven, npm, gradle, pip
- CI/CD tools (Jenkins, Travis)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE), i.e. IntelliJ Idea, Visual Studio Code,
- DevOps (Ansible, Vagrant, VMs, linux)
- Security (password vaults, certificates)
- Software quality
    - test libraries
    - code quality and code conventions, say Findbugs, Jacoco, PMD, Sonar Cube, etc...
- and a LOT more

##Intention
