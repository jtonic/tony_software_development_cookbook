# An example of APNs server/client/mock

## TODO list

1. [ ] create the p12/pem certificates/keys
1. [x] create the mock APNs server
1. [ ] create and test an APNs client
1. [ ] use java ssl instead of native ssl to not have troubles on other machines.

## Issues

1. The `ApnsClientApp` doesn't work because of the key/certificates thingy
