# Tony's software development cookbook


In this book  

In time, because its huge popularity, it started to conquer some other peaks such as:

- backend development (NodeJS, ExpressJS)
- tooling (npm/yarn, webpack, gulp, grunt)
- mobile (Xamarim, React Native, Cordova)
- desktop (Electron, Athom, Visual Studio Code)
- presentation (RevealJS, Reveal-md, gitbook)

The attached [github pages presentation](https://jtonic.github.io/js_ecosystem_for_the_impatient/) is about how to get quite acquainted to the JS ecosystem. It is not a deep dive in the included topics but my abition is to create a good presentation for the impatient.

- [x] publish github book to github pages with TravisCI
- [ ] Finish the content of the npm chapter

> **Disclose**:
>
> > This book is produced by gitbook-cli js tool from markdown files.

> > The publication to [Projec github Page](https://jtonic.github.io/js_ecosystem_for_the_impatient/) is done with TravisCI and its amazing and free support for github (pages).

> > Another alternative would be the use of JS presentation libraries (RevealJS/reveal-md), but because of some glitches I stumbled upon down the path I gave up (at least temporarily considering I'd rather prefer the book appeal versus a presentation).
